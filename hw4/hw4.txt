1. Then, download the RSat SAT solver from (http://reasoning.cs.ucla.edu/rsat/). Read the 
manual carefully. Use RSat to solve the SAT instance obtained above. Is the instance 
satisfiable?
    This instance, coloring graph1 with k = 3 colors, is unsatisfiable.

2. Do the conversion again, this time, with 4 colors. Use RSat to solve this new SAT instance. 
Is the instance satisfiable?
    The instance of coloring graph1 with k = 4 colors is satisfiable.

3. What do the answers of these two SAT instances tell you about the graph coloring 
problem of the above graph? Can you give a solution (a coloring) to the graph 
coloring problem of the above graph based on the results of RSat?
    The first instance tells me that there does not exist an assignment of colors 1 through k (1, 2, 3) to
each node in graph1 that does not break the constraints of the problem (the constraints generated by the CNF
where no two nodes connected by an edge can have the same color).
    The second instance tells me that there is an assignment of colors 1 through k (1,2, 3, 4) to each node in
graph1 that does not break the constraints of the problem (no two nodes connected by an edge can have the 
same color).
    We can give a solution (a coloring) for graph1 for when k = 4 (4 colors) and not when k = 3 (3 colors)
based on the results of RSat (unsatisfiable and satisfiable respectively). When k = 4, the RSat produces the 
following solution: 
-1 -28 -27 -26 25 -21 -9 -5 -24 -23 22 -18 -2 -14 -20 -19 17 -13 -16 15 -11 -12 10 -6 -8 7 -3 4 0
    The positive numbers are 25, 22, 17, 15, 10, 7, 4.
    25 => node 7 is colored 1
    22 => node 6 is colored 2
    17 => node 5 is colored 1
    15 => node 4 is colored 3
    10 => node 3 is colored 2
    7 => node 2 is colored 3
    4 => node 1 is colored 4

4. Now, use a similar approach to solve the graph coloring of the graph described in 
graph2.txt. What is the minimum number of colors required to properly color this 
graph?
    The minimum number of colors required to properly color graph2 is 8 colors.
